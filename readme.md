# html5chan: an (incomplete) userscript

Too hipster to use 4chanX? Have a craving for the *bleeding edge*? Try out my 4chan userscript, and submit some bug reports! 

html5chan is alpha software; features and bugs will be added, changed, or removed without any notice. It probably works on Firefox >=11, and Chrome >=18.

[Install html5chan alpha](http://queue-.github.com/html5chan/html5chan@httpsgithubcomqueue-html5chan.user.js)

## Building from source

You'll need node, coco, stylus, nib, and underscore. Run 'coke build' or 'coke watch' to compile everything into one userscript.
